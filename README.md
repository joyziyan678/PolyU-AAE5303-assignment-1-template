# AAE5303 Environment Setup Report — Template for Students

> **Important:** Follow this structure exactly in your submission README.  
> Your goal is to demonstrate **evidence, process, problem-solving, and reflection** — not only screenshots.

---

## 2. Python Environment Check

### 2.1 Steps Taken

Describe briefly how you created/activated your Python environment:

**Tool used:**  
_[venv / conda / system Python]_

**Key commands you ran:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Any deviations from the default instructions:**  
_[Describe any changes you made, or write "None"]_

### 2.2 Test Results

Run these commands and paste the actual terminal output (not just screenshots):

```bash
python scripts/test_python_env.py
```

**Output:**
```
Step 1: Environment snapshot
  Why: We capture platform/Python/ROS variables to diagnose common setup mistakes (especially mixed ROS env).
Step 2: Python version
  Why: The course assumes Python 3.10+; older versions often break package wheels.
Step 3: Python imports (required/optional)
  Why: Imports verify packages are installed and compatible with your Python version.
Step 4: NumPy sanity checks
  Why: We run a small linear algebra operation so success means more than just `import numpy`.
Step 5: SciPy sanity checks
  Why: We run a small FFT to confirm SciPy is functional (not just installed).
Step 6: Matplotlib backend check
  Why: We generate a tiny plot image (headless) to confirm plotting works on your system.
Step 7: OpenCV PNG decoding (subprocess)
  Why: PNG decoding uses native code; we isolate it so corruption/codec issues cannot crash the whole report.
Step 8: Open3D basic geometry + I/O (subprocess)
  Why: Open3D is a native extension; ABI mismatches can segfault. Subprocess isolation turns crashes into readable failures.
Step 9: ROS toolchain checks
  Why: The course requires ROS tooling. This check passes if ROS 2 OR ROS 1 is available (either one is acceptable).
  Action: building ROS 2 workspace package `env_check_pkg` (this may take 1-3 minutes on first run)...
  Action: running ROS 2 talker/listener for a few seconds to verify messages flow...
Step 10: Basic CLI availability
  Why: We confirm core commands exist on PATH so students can run the same commands as in the labs.

## 3. ROS 2 Workspace Check

### 3.1 Build the workspace

Paste the build output summary (final lines only):

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
```

**Expected output:**
```
Summary: 1 package finished [x.xx s]
```

**Your actual output:**
```
Summary: 1 package finished [0.62s]
```

### 3.2 Run talker and listener

Show both source commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Then run talker:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg talker.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[INFO] [1768579259.660809361] [env_check_pkg_listener]: AAE5303 listener awaiting messages.

```

**Run listener:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg listener.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[INFO] [1768579551.129601357] [env_check_pkg_listener]: AAE5303 listener awaiting messages.
